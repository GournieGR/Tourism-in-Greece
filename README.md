# Tourism in Greece
A program that has been made to show users the tourism that came to Greece in the period 2011-2015. The program is interactive as it contains GUIs and graphs for easy user familiarity. Specifically, with the help of the statistics.gr website, we retrieved our data, which we placed in Excel files. With the help of the python pandas library we cleaned our data and then put it in CSV files. From that point on our data was represented in graphs. The GUI was also implemented with the help of the tkinter module.
